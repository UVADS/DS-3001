# Week 11: Reinforcement lab
Welcome to week 11 where we will do a reinforcement lab.

Let's take a look at the standard diagram (credit ref. [1])

Ok, that was a dad joke, I couldn't help myself. That diagram is about Reinforcement Learning. Let's get to what we really mean, reinforcing the concepts from the past few weeks. The way we are going to do that is review, question, explore. (also known as KWL ref. [2]).

## A little about Pete
1. PhD in particle physics
2. Lead of Research Computing for the School of Data Science
3. LPA2A@virginia.edu

## Goals for Today
* You learn something
* I learn something
* Everyone makes a PR to this repo (details at end)

## Today's Dataset
* We will be using a mystery dataset today: [mystery data](https://www.17lands.com/public_datasets)

## Let's Get Started
1. Download the data
2. Un zip the data
3. Load the data into a dataframe
4. Make a scatter plot of << insert two variables here >>
5. do some clustering -- to what end
6. Now explore, get creative

(tar,knn,why cluster, save 20 for show and tell)

# PR details
1. fork this repo: https://github.com/alonzi/DS-3001
2. create a file called [uvaNetID].R in the folder petes-session (eg for me: petes-session/LPA2A.R) << this may go to knitr markdwon something >>
3. the file must contain one thing you haven't done before aka something you learned today in this session
4. submit your pull request (don't forget to explain it in the PR itself)
5. stick with it, your assignment isn't complete until I merge the PR, we will have discussions in the comments
