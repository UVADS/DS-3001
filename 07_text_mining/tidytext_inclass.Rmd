Let's look at a slightly larger dataset. As referenced in Text Mining with R, a package gutenbergr provides access to the public domain items from the Gutenberg Project. Let's take a look. To learn more check out this link: <https://ropensci.org/tutorials/gutenbergr_tutorial/>

```{r}
eng_gut <- gutenberg_works(languages = "en", only_text = TRUE, distinct = TRUE)

gutenberg_works(str_detect(title, "Kennedy"))

eng_gut %>%
  filter(str_detect(title, "Kennedy"))

kennedy_inag <- gutenberg_download(3, mirror="http://mirrors.xmission.com/gutenberg/") #had to use a new mirror as the default mirror was down, list of mirrors is here: https://www.gutenberg.org/MIRRORS.ALL

#Let's take a look at the speech from 1961
View(kennedy_inag)

#Looks like we have some extra info there at the top so let's remove those rows.

kennedy_inag <- kennedy_inag[13:143, ]

kennedy_inag <- kennedy_inag %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)%>%
  anti_join(stop_words)%>%
  count(word, sort=TRUE)

#Biden's speech

biden_inag <- read_lines("data/biden_inag.txt")

  unnest_tokens(word, biden_inag)%>%
  anti_join(stop_words)%>% 
  count(word, sort=TRUE)

View(biden_inag)

```

Ok, now that we have our word frequencies let's do some analysis. We will compare the three speeches using sentiment analysis to see if the generally align or not. 

```{r}
#helps with the sentiment analysis, using package "textdata"

get_sentiments('afinn')# we see a list of words and there classification, 2,467 - not really that many overall. 

get_sentiments('nrc')# looks like a good amount more 13,891, but as we can see words are classified in several different categories. 

get_sentiments('bing')# looks like a good amount more 6,776, but as we can see just negative and positive. 

get_sentiments('afinn')

kenn_sentiment_affin <- kennedy_inag %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("afinn"))#using a inner join to match words and add the sentiment variable

kenn_sentiment_nrc <- kennedy_inag %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("nrc"))

kenn_sentiment_bing <- kennedy_inag %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing"))

View(kenn_sentiment_affin)

#Walk through the same process for Trump 

trump_sentiment_afinn <- trump_inag %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("afinn"))
  
trump_sentiment_nrc <- trump_inag %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("nrc"))

trump_sentiment_bing <- trump_inag %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing"))

View(trump_sentiment_afinn)

#again for Biden
biden_sentiment_afinn <- biden_inag %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("afinn"))
  
biden_sentiment_nrc <- biden_inag %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("nrc"))

biden_sentiment_bing <- biden_inag %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing"))

View(biden_sentiment_nrc)
```

Now that we have our sentiment let's do some quick comparisons

```{r}
#We can just do some tabling to see the differences in bing and nrc, seems like Kennedy's speech at least first glanced was much more balanced in terms of negative/positive sentiment
table(trump_sentiment_bing$sentiment)
table(kenn_sentiment_bing$sentiment)
table(biden_sentiment_bing$sentiment)

table(trump_sentiment_nrc$sentiment)
table(kenn_sentiment_nrc$sentiment)
table(biden_sentiment_nrc$sentiment)

View(kenn_sentiment_affin)

ggplot(data = kenn_sentiment_affin, 
       aes(x=value)
        )+
  geom_histogram()+
  ggtitle("Kennendy Sentiment Range")+
  theme_minimal()


ggplot(data = trump_sentiment_afinn, 
       aes(x=value)
        )+
  geom_histogram()+
  ggtitle("Trump Sentiment Range")+
  theme_minimal()


ggplot(data = biden_sentiment_afinn, 
       aes(x=value)
        )+
  geom_histogram()+
  ggtitle("Biden Sentiment Range")+
  theme_minimal()

#Again they look very different, which leads to all kinds of interesting questions around the current state of affairs at the time these speeches were given and enforces the idea that text needs to be analyzed in the context of when it was written.....Hermeneutics! I would reference this debate between Nixon and Kennedy to get a basic idea of the events being confronted at this time. 

#https://www.jfklibrary.org/asset-viewer/archives/TNC/TNC-172/TNC-172

#Could also do simple word clouds as we see, Trump is much more focused on the US whereas Kennedy references the "World" at a higher rate. 

#below uses the ggwordcloud package


ggplot(kennedy_inag[1:50,], aes(label = word, size = n)
       ) +
  geom_text_wordcloud() +
  theme_minimal()

ggplot(trump_inag[1:50,], aes(label = word, size = n)
       ) +
  geom_text_wordcloud() +
  theme_minimal()

ggplot(biden_inag[1:50,], aes(label = word, size = n)
       ) +
  geom_text_wordcloud() +
  theme_minimal()


```

term frequency - inverse document frequency tf-idf. Here we are going to treat
each of our speeches as a document in a corpus and explore the relative 
importance of words to these speeches as compared to the overall corpus.
