    "The goal of this lab is to optimize a Random Forest model using the provided dataset.  The guidance this week is less prescriptive in terms of steps, so use the skills you have gained over the semester to build and evaluate the RF model. You will be graded on your model building, interpretation of the results and explanation of model selection. As always, rely on your teams but submit your own code. Lastly, there are likely several correct approaches involving a variety of different conclusions, just make sure your conclusions are supported by your approach.    \n",
