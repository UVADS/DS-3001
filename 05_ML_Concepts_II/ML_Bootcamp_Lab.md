Goal: Build three pipelines using three different datasets 

Step one: Choose three datasets from [Data.World](https://data.world/)

Step two: Work through the steps outlined in the examples to include the following elements: 

  * Machine Learning Questions 
  * Independent Business Metric 
  * Data preparation:  
    * correct variable classification
    * collapse factor levels as needed
    * one-hot encoding factor variables 
    * normalize the continous variables
    * drop unneeded variables
    * create target variable if needed
  * Calculate the prevalance 
  * Create the necessary data partitions (Train,Tune,Test)
  * Build the initial model using the provided code 
  * Evaluation the model built by the training data (keep in mind the prevalance)
  * Explore the variable importance measures, what do the results tell you? 
  * Predict using the tune data 
  * Evaluate using the confusion matrix function
      * Did the model perform better or worse than the training version?
  * Write a summary of your findings. What do you know now that you didn't when you started? What items are you concerned about
