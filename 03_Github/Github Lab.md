Build a three ggplot graphs as a team using Github both from managing a repo and creating a pull request. 

1. One of your team members should create a new repo and manage access by giving write access to team members by added them as contributors.  

2. Dividing the graph into three phases: 1) getting data loaded, 2) selecting the aes/adding labels, 3) and adding finishing details, assign a team member to each task. 

3. Each team member takes a turn contributing at each stage. If you have four team members divide the third step into 2 steps and build four graphs.

4. Pull requests  allow for one feature to be added to your script. 
Create a new fork for each feature, download clone to repo,  develop the new code, push the code to the fork and create a a pull request.

***Important Tip*** You must fork the code in order so wait until your previous group member has completed the pull request process then fork the latest version of the code.

4. Pull requests allow for one feature to be added to your script. 
Create a new fork for each feature, download/clone the repo,  develop the new code, push the code to the fork and create a a pull request. 


Verbs in order: 
fork, clone, develop code, push, and pull request 

5. Whomever is leading the first phase (getting data loaded) 
will also complete the merging of the pull request(s) from the feature branch 
into the main branch. 

6. Use a different datasets and produce different graphs for each dataset 
(don't push 3 scatter plots)

7. Have separate Rscript or Rmarkdown files for each visualization. 

8. Submit to the link to the repo in which you approved the pull requests.
