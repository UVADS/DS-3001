Build a three ggplot graphs as a team using Github both from managing a repo and
creating a pull request. 

1. Create a new repo and manage access by giving with write access to team members.  

2. Dividing the graph into three phases: 1) getting data loaded, 2) selecting the aes/adding labels, 3) and adding finishing details, assign a team member to each task. 

3. Each team member should have a turn contributing at each stage. If you have 
four team members divide the third step into 2 steps and build four graphes.

4. Pull requests  allow for one feature to be added to your script. 
Create a new fork for each feature, develop the new code, and create a
a pull request. 

5. Whomever is leading the first phase (getting data loaded) 
will also complete the merging of the pull request(s) from the feature branch 
into the main branch. 

6. Use a different datasets and produce different graphs for each dataset 
(don't push 3 scatter plots)

7. Have separate Rscript or Rmarkdown files for each visualization. 

8. Submit to collab the URL for the orginal(origin) repo.
