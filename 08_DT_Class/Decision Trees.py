# ## Let's Build the Model 

# %%
#Three steps in building a ML model
#Step 1: Cross validation process- the process by which the training data will be used to build the initial model must be set. As seen below:

kf = RepeatedStratifiedKFold(n_splits=10,n_repeats =5, random_state=42)
# number - number of folds
# repeats - number of times the CV is repeated, takes the average of these repeat rounds

# This essentially will split our training data into k groups. For each unique group it will hold out one as a test set
# and take the remaining groups as a training set. Then, it fits a model on the training set and evaluates it on the test set.
# Retains the evaluation score and discards the model, then summarizes the skill of the model using the sample of model evaluation scores we choose

# %%
#What score do we want our model to be built on? Let's use:
#AUC for the ROC curve - remember this is measures how well our model distiguishes between classes
#Recall - this is sensitivity of our model, also known as the true positive rate (predicted pos when actually pos)
#Balanced accuracy - this is the (sensitivity + specificity)/2, or we can just say it is the number of correctly predicted data points
print(metrics.SCORERS.keys()) #find them

# %%
#Define score, these are the keys we located above. This is what the models will be scored by
scoring = ['roc_auc','recall','balanced_accuracy']

# %%
#Step 2: Usually involves setting a hyper-parameter search. This is optional and the hyper-parameters vary by model. 
#define parameters, we can use any number of the ones below but let's start with only max depth
#this will help us find a good balance between under fitting and over fitting in our model
