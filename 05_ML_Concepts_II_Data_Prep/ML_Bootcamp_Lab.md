Goal: Build two data prep pipelines using different datasets to get practice with data preparation and question building.

Step one: Review these two datasets and brainstorm problems that could be addressed with the dataset. Identify a question for each dataset.

Step two: Work through the steps outlined in the examples to include the following elements: 

  * What is a independent Business Metric for your problem? 
  * Data preparation:  
    * correct variable type as needed
    * collapse factor levels as needed
    * one-hot encoding factor variables 
    * normalize the continuous variables
    * drop unneeded variables
    * create target variable if needed
  * Calculate the prevalence 
  * Create the necessary data partitions (Train,Tune,Test)
  
Step three: What do your instincts tell you about the data. Can it address your problem, what areas/items are you worried about?
