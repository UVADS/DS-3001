In the world of data, big data is the topic that is on everyone's mind. Thus, it's no surprise that big data is finding its way into the simple, mundane tasks we find ourselves doing. For instance, creating an efficient schedule can be time-consuming. However, with the virtual personal assistant and workload automation software tools, one could optimize and complete tasks in record time. The article also details an enterprise social networking tool similar to **Slack** that allows for employees to utilize the powerful nature of direct messaging, which would push out the need for work emails and maximize time at the office. Ultimately, big data is everywhere and it's time we embrace it.

### Basic Article Stats

paged_table(stat)
```

### What Do I Think?
I think the article gives good advice for businesses to utilize big data tools in manageable ways. Some older company's might be scared of the technological era that we are in, but with simple tools such as a virtual personal assistant, companys can slowly begin to integrate big data into their workspaces. Sooner rather than later, they will begin to realize the benefits of a company social media platform or the cloud.
